        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>Video games are one of my favorite hobbies. I play video games in my free time after completing task for school and like immersing myself as the main charcter in the video game.
            Some of my favorite games are Skyrim, <br> Red Dead Redemption 2, Terraria.I was introduced to video games at a young age by watching my older brother
            play video games on his Xbox 360. I would occasionally be allowed to play on his Xbox 360 and would be hooked into the game instantly.

            Computers
        </h2>
        <p>Computers are really cool. I got into computers by browsing the web. I like how computers operate and have built my own personal computer before. 
            I had to learn a bit of information online through <br> Youtubers such as LinusTechTips to build a computer. It took a few hours to build my own personal computer 
            for the first time. But the satisfaction of finally completing the build was worth it.

        <h2>Absolute and/or Relative Links</h2>
        <p>Relative links are links that you use to go to different webpage for your <strong>own</strong> website. Relative links allow you to easily change the name or location of the webpage without any hassle.
            An example of Relative links is <a href="./profilepage.html">ProfilePage</a>. <br> An absolute link are usually used to link websites that are not your
            <strong>own</strong> websites. Absolute link looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>.
