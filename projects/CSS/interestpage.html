            <h2 class="title">Video Games</h2>
        <p><span class="emphasize">Video games</span> are one of my favorite hobbies. I <span class="emphasize">play video games in my free time</span> after completing task for school and like immersing myself as the main charcter in the video game. <br>
            Some of my favorite games are <span class="emphasize">Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption 2, Terraria</span> and many more that I haven't mentioned in this paragraph.<br><span class="emphasize">I was introduced to video games at a young age</span> by watching my older brother
            play video games on his Xbox 360. I would occasionally be allowed to play on his Xbox 360 and would be hooked into the game instantly.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Computers</h2>
        <p>Computers are really cool. <span class="emphasize">I got into computers by browsing the web</span>. I like how computers operate and have built my own personal computer before. 
            I had to learn a bit of information online through <br> <span class="emphasize">Youtubers</span> such as <span class="emphasize">LinusTechTips</span> to build a computer. It took a few hours to build my own personal computer 
            for the first time. But the satisfaction of finally completing the build was worth it.

        <h2 class="title">Absolute and/or Relative Links</h2>
        <p>Relative links are links that you use to go to different webpage for <span class="emphasize">your own website</span>. Relative links allow you to <span class="emphasize">easily change the name or location</span> of the webpage without any hassle.
            An example of Relative links is <a href="../profilepage.html">ProfilePage</a>. <br> An absolute link are usually used to link webpages that are <span class="emphasize">not your
                websites</span>. Absolute link looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>.
