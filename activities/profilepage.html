            One of my interests is learning more about <strong>computers</strong> and how they function. As I grew up, I was surrounded
            with different type of systems such as the Xbox 360 and desktops, It peaked my interests.<br>I learned more about computers parts as I stumbled upon videos
            where people decided to build computers on Youtube. One of the channels that was informative was LinusTechTips. One tags I learned about was the paragraph tag <br>
            which looks like &lt;p&gt; &lt;&sol;p&gt;

                Another one of my interest/hobby is playing <strong>video games</strong>. This interests was actually a big reason why I got interested into computers as
                I grew up playing video games on the Xbox 360 console. <br> I was around 6 years old when I was introduced to video games. I remember watching
                my brother playing Halo and GTA everyday and It just got me hooked into gaming in general. These games back in the were <br> &dollar;60 unlike modern games today
                which are &dollar;70.

    <blockquote>
        "Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. <br>
        You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. <br>
        Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.‚Äù
