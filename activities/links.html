        <ul>
            <li>Absolute Link will alwayas work, if you have the correct url. Relative Links are to <strong>your</strong> website only.
                You would usually use relative links because you can easily change the name of your webpage and can move the webpage more easily.
            </li>
            <li>There are three rules of a relative link.The first rule is a period ".", which means the current folder. The second rule is two periods "..", which means a parent folder.
                the third rule is the slash "/", which means to start at the root.
            </li>
            <li>Links do not always have to be inside the NAV Tag</li>
