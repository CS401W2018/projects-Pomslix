        <li>The Title is going to be the most popular video games and will be about popular video games</li>
        <li>I chose this topic because I am someone who is interested in video games, played since I was young. Saw my first video game on a mobile like Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joy Ride. Then everything else came about and that's lead me to this.</li>
        <li>On the Home Page, I will have the design of a page that will get the readers or users to be interested in my webpages. On each of the content webpages, I will talk about a genre of video games and why its popular and list some video games that are popular in that genre. For tables, I will be displaying revenues made from Gacha games during the month,etc.</li>
        <li>For my forms, I will be having a form to sign up to receive emails and have the user add their name, email, age, gender, a donation box(fake). I will put revenues made from a month of work from gacha games into the table</li>
        <li>I will be using websites for my resources/information because they are more knowledgeable than I am. I will create some images(like drawing them myself) to use so I don't get copy righted and use some non copyrighted images. Two resources are Steam Charts, for player counts, and official websites of games.</li>
        <li>I have read the warnings below listed in the Final Proposal and acknowledge that I will not be trying or attempting those warnings that have been listed out for the students to read.</li>
