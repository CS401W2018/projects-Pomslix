                    <h1>Terraria</h1>
                        <p>Terraria is a 2d survival game that only has survival mode. It is similar to Minecraft, but is in 2D. Both games are very unique in their own way. You can also build whatever you want in Terraria just like in Minecraft, but you have to get creative with building around the 2D limitations. The End goal of Terraria is to be beat the Moon Lord.</p>
